# ChristmasDeerGame
Course project on the discipline "programming". The project is made in 2019, using C++ programming language and SDL 2 library.
The development of the project was inspired by the game flappy bird. The main character of the game is a Christmas reindeer.
In the game, there are several types of pipes that the reindeer has to jump between:
- regular pipe
- healing pipe
- bonus level launching pipe (in it the speed of movement is higher, but more points are given for each pipe).
